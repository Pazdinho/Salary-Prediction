# Salary Prediction

This is the *Salary prediction* project I made myself.


<p>In this project, I will learn how to apply scikit-learn library to fit linear models, use them for prediction, compare the models, and select the best one. I will also learn how to carry out testing for certain issues with data.</p><br/><br/>
